# Template job config for running the log exporter on the cluster as a daemonset.
# Creates everything within 'logexporter' namespace.
#
# Note: Since daemonsets have "AlwaysRestart" policy for pods, we provide a long
# sleep-duration (24 hr) to the logexporter pods so they don't finish the work and
# get restarted while some pods are still running. So it is your duty to detect
# the work has been done (or use some timeout) and delete the daemonset yourself.
