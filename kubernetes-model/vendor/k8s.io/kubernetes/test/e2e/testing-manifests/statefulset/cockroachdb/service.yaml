    # edge cases where instance 0 comes up after losing its data and needs to
    # decide whether it should create a new cluster or try to join an existing
    # one. If it creates a new cluster when it should have joined an existing
    # one, we'd end up with two separate clusters listening at the same service
    # endpoint, which would be very bad.
